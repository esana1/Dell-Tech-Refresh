# Dell-Tech-Refresh
This project focuses on Dell's Tech Refresh program, aiming to identify and retrieve parts that are reaching end-of-life (EOL) to ensure the availability of used parts for service warranty. By targeting these parts and offering rewards to existing customers, we aim to optimize resource utilization and achieve significant cost savings.
